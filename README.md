A2Z institute wants to provide an estimate of the average score obtained by aspirants who enroll in their program. Keeping in mind the variation in scores every year, the institute wants to provide a more reliable estimate of the average score using a range of scores instead of a single estimate. It is known from previous records that the standard deviation of the scores is 10 and the cut-off score in the most recent year was 84.

A recent social media post from A2Z institute received feedback from a reputed critic, mentioning that the students from A2Z institute score less than last year's cut-off on average. The institute wants to test if the claim by the critic is valid.
